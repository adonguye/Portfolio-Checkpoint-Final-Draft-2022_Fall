			Almost every week, I saw a new beach and got to experience sunsets I'll never forget. Sometimes while lying in the sand,
			I would have cute beach dogs run up to me. On other days, I would collect sea glass in the shallow waters.
		</p>
		<p>
			St. Croix has a region of the island with what locals call a rainforest. This was a very remote part of the island, and
			many people who could live in this area were self-sustaining. This became extremely important as hurricane
			season came each year. It was interesting coming to St.Croix before hurricane season because I could see the waters get
			rougher as the summer progressed. This became apparent as I learned how to scuba dive at Cane Bay.
		</p>

		   Cane Bay is a beautiful beach that I spent many weekends on because it had so many fishes and was popular among locals.
		   There was a famous dive shop nearby, and I had a lot of fun snorkeling around the water with my friends.
		   I saw a variety of fish and way too many sea urchins under my feet. During one of my dives out in this water,
		   I got scratched up pretty bad, but it didn't hurt because of the salt water.
